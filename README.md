# HSLU_Planica_GS_VR

This project uses the Unity engine and utilizes the XR Interaction Toolkit and assets generated by the Unity Gaussian Splatting Plugin. Please note that Gaussian Splats are not included in this repository; only the asset files generated by the plugin are included.

## Built With

- **Unity Engine**: The 3D engine used for the development.
- **XR Interaction Toolkit (3.0.1)**: Provides tools and components for building immersive VR cross-platform interactions. Starter assets are included to make implementation more streamlined and more straightforward.
- **Unity Gaussian Splatting Plugin**: This tool generates assets based on PLY files within Unity and then renders those. For more information, check the plugin's official repository: [Unity Gaussian Splatting Plugin](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting).

## Tested On

- **Meta Quest 3**: This project has been thoroughly tested on the Meta Quest 3 VR headset to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Meta Quest 2**: All features have been co-tested on a Meta Quest 2
- **Mock HMD**: MockHMD can be used for easy testing in Unity. This allows to quickly test interactions with mouse and keyboard
